Pseudocode:
function findArray(arr):
    if arr is empty:
        return 0  // Handle the case of an empty input array.

    maxSum = arr[0]  // Initialize maxSum with the first element of the array.
    currentSum = arr[0]  // Initialize currentSum with the first element of the array.

    for i from 1 to length of arr - 1:
        // Compare the current element with the sum of the current subarray.
        // If the current element is greater, start a new subarray.
        currentSum = max(arr[i], currentSum + arr[i])

        // Update maxSum if the current subarray sum is greater.
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)
    return maxSum


Space and Time Complexity:
    Time Complexity: O(n)
        The algorithm iterates through the input array once, where "n" is the length of the array.
        Each element is processed exactly once, and the algorithm maintains two variables (maxSum and currentSum) that are updated in constant time operations.
        Therefore, the time complexity is linear, O(n), making it very efficient for large arrays.

    Space Complexity: O(1)
        The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space to store the two variables: maxSum and currentSum.
        It doesn't require any additional data structures or arrays that grow with the input size.
        As a result, the space complexity is constant, O(1), which means the algorithm is highly memory-efficient and doesn't consume additional memory based on the size of the input.
